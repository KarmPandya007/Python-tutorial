# If-Else
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")

# Loops
# For Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(f"For Loop Iteration: {i}")

# While Loop
count = 0

# Exercise
"""
1. Write an if-else statement to check if a number is even or odd.
2. Use a for loop to iterate over a list of numbers and print each number.
